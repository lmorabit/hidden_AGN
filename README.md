**A hidden Active Galactic Nuclei population: the first radio luminosity functions by physical process**

Both star formation (SF) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play an important role in galaxy evolution. Quantifying
their relative importance in a statistical way can be done using radio luminosity functions. Until now these have
relied on galaxy classifications, where sources with a mixture of radio emission from SF and AGN are labelled as
either a star-forming galaxy or an AGN. This can lead to the under- or over-estimation of the relevance of AGN.
Brightness temperature methods were demonstrated to be effective at separating radio emission from AGN and SF
at 144 MHz using sub-arcsecond imaging with the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT). We use the combination
of sub-arcsecond and arcsecond resolution imaging of 7,497 sources in the Lockman Hole and ELAIS-N1 fields to
identify AGN components in the high resolution images and subtract them from the total flux density, leaving flux
density from SF only. We construct, for the first time, radio luminosity functions by physical process, either SF or
AGN activity, revealing a hidden AGN population at L<sub>144MHz</sub>< 10<sup>24</sup> W Hz<sup>−1</sup>. This population is 1.56±0.06 more
than expected for 0.5 < z < 2.0 when comparing to RLFs by galaxy classification. The star forming population is less
impacted, with only 0.90±0.02 of the expected star formation. The contribution of ‘hidden’ AGN to the overall radio
population, especially at L<sub>144MHz</sub>< 10<sup>24</sup> W Hz<sup>−1</sup>, can have significant implications for the cosmic star formation rate
and kinetic luminosity densities.

**NOTE:** The code to generate Vmaxes and RLFs is included, but takes about 5 hours to run. The full_* files will run this, but the intermediate files are provided in the data directory so this does not have to be done just to generate the figures.
